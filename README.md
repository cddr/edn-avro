# edn-avro

Lossless conversion between EDN and Avro (and back)

## Rationale

In jackdaw, we made the mistake of getting into the business of
maintaining a custom mapping between EDN and Avro. This meant we
ended up duplicating a lot of code in order to marshall data
from one format into another

I'm aware of at least two problems with this approach.

 1. There have been (and likely remain) subtle bugs in the implementation
    which do not exist in the upstream implementation of avro. For example...

     * https://github.com/FundingCircle/jackdaw/commit/26ec1e2fd14716ab923b17c43422dca5e6383484#diff-6ea591afdb2bef0213a7d11717398160
     * https://github.com/FundingCircle/jackdaw/commit/eede5cc29b475bc2d24e4f1e9a8264a9c607438a#diff-6ea591afdb2bef0213a7d11717398160
     * https://github.com/FundingCircle/jackdaw/commit/5b0661ec5f8a552c27de0e388db09abedea6f52a#diff-6ea591afdb2bef0213a7d11717398160

 2. The EDN representation we chose is "lossy" compared with the standard
    JSON representation. When an avro union type is used, the JSON respresentation
		includes a tag to indicate which "branch" of the union is matched. In our
		custom EDN representation, no such tag is included. You just get the data
		and the consuming code must figure out itself which branch of the schema
		was matched.

This library aims to resolve these problems by creating a simple
utility to convert an EDN object into a avro GenericData instance
and vice-versa. Armed with a utility such as this, there is no
longer a need to use custom implementations of KafkaAvroSerializer
and Serde interfaces. Instead we just use the standard implmentations
and convert our EDN data into a GenericData instance before passing
it along.

## Usage

```
(ns my.cool.app
  (:require
    [cddr.edn-avro :as avro]))

(def schema "string")
(def msg "yolo")

(def msg-as-avro (avro/as-avro msg {:schema schema}))

(def msg-as-edn (avro/as-edn msg-as-avro {:schema schema}))

msg-as-edn
=> "yolo"

```
